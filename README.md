# PlasRAG

PlasRAG is a deep learning-based tool specifically designed for analyzing plasmids, which serves two purposes: (1) plasmid property characterization, and (2) plasmid DNA sequence retrieval. Users can easily input their interested plasmid sequences as queries. Then, PlasRAG can (1) describe the query plasmids based on predicted properties and information from relevant literature, (2) retrieve eligible plasmids based on selected property queries in Boolean expression form.

## Full command-line options
preprocessing.py:
```
Usage of preprocessing.py:
        [--fasta FASTA] FASTA file of the input plasmid DNA sequences (either complete sequences or contigs) to be characterized or retrieved by the PlasRAG tool, default: example_data/test_plasmids.fasta
        [--model_path MODEL_PATH] path of the folder storing the downloaded models, default: models
        [--midfolder] folder to store the intermediate files for prediction, default: temp
        [--esm] path of the ESM-2 model (esm2_t33_650M_UR50D.pt), which can be downloaded at: https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D.pt, default: ./esm2_t33_650M_UR50D.pt
        [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE] batch size for prediction, default: 64
        [--database DATABASE] path of the PlasRAG database folder, default: ./database
        [--threads THREADS] number of threads utilized for prediction if 'cpu' is detected ('cuda' not found), default: 8
```

characterize.py
```
Usage of characterize.py:
        [--query] question or instruction regarding the query plasmids, default: 'Please summarize key information from the most relevant literature.'
        [--out] path to store the prediction results, default: results
        [--llm] whether to enable LLM for result summarization and question answering, default: 'True'
        [--llama] the downloaded Llama3 model id, default: 'meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct'
        [--quantize] whether to load the Llama-3 model in 8-bit or 4-bit, which can largely decrease memory usage ('False', '8bit', or '4bit'), default: '8bit'
        [--midfolder] the intermediate folder generated by preprocessing.py, default: ./temp
        [--database] path of the PlasRAG database folder, default: ./database
        [--threads] number of threads utilized for prediction if 'cpu' is detected ('cuda' not found), default: 8
```

retrieve.py
```
Usage of retrieve.py:
        [--query] query boolean expression combined with property IDs and logical operators ('and', 'or', 'not'), e.g., 'CH1000 and (AM3000 or AM3002 or AM3016)', default: 'CH1000'
        [--midfolder] the intermediate folder generated by preprocessing.py, default: ./temp
        [--database DATABASE] path of the PlasRAG database folder, default: ./database
```
